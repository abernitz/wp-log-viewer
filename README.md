### Admin Bar Widget

The admin bar widget gives you glanceable information such as debug log mode and error count where ever you are in wp-admin.  You will always know when there are errors and can access the log viewer with on click for additional details.

This is one of my favourite features.


### Clear Log

Easily clear your debug.log file with one click.


### Group View

Log entries are group making it much easier to see each unique error.  You can click to list the date and times when the error occured.  Grouped entries can be sorted by newest or latest.


### List View

All log entries are listed by date and time and can be sorted by newest or latest.


### Sort By Date

Log entries can be sorted by date by newest or latest in either list or group views.


### Automatic Refresh

Log automatically refreshes to display new errors.  No need to manually refresh the screen.  However, there is a link to manually refresh if desired.


### Realtime Search

Quickly search and find specific errors.


### Error Color Legend

Errors are color coded to make it easier to identify certain errors such as fatal, notices, warnings, deprecated and database.


### Debug Status

Debugging status is located at the top of the viewer and admin bar to make it easy to see if debugging is enabled or disabled.

You can also see log size and last modified timestamp.  This information automatically updates when changed.


### Dashboard Widget

This widget gives you a quick summary regarding how many and what type of errors are in the log view.  You can also access the log viewer with just one click.
